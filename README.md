# Hi there! I'm Yi-Ling ðŸ‘‹
This repository consists of projects that I have done whilst pursuing my masters in Business Analytics at Bayes Business School. 

Through my projects, I developed proficiency in Python, R programming and SQL, and now I can carry out tasks, such as:
- carry out data cleaning and preprocessing 
- web scraping (using BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Twint API, Tweepy API, Reddit API)
- uncover patterns and insights
- communicate crtical findings with stakeholders

# Portfolio Projects
### Project 1: Effects of COVID-19 on UK businesses 
**Repository:**  [`Companies House Analysis`](https://github.com/ngyiling/companies-house-analysis) <br />
**Description:** This individual project aims to analyse Companies House data and produce data visualisations, to show the impact of the pandemic on UK business foundation patterns.  <br />
**Technology:** Pandas, Geopandas, Geopy, Plotly <br />

### Project 2: What makes TikTok' videos popular?
**Repository:** [`Popular TikTok Videos Visualisation`](https://github.com/ngyiling/popular-tiktok-videos-visualisation) <br />
**Description:** This group project aims to analyse 1000 trending TikTok videos and produce data visualisations that explain the underlying pattern of 'what makes TikTok videos popular!'. <br />
**Technology:** TextBlob, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy <br />


 ### Project 3: Time series prediction using RNN and CNN
 **Code:** [`TimeSeriesPrediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/ngyiling/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/TimeSeriesPrediction.ipynb)<br />
 **h5 file of the best model:** [`best_model.h5`](https://github.com/ngyiling/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/best_model.h5) <br />
 **Description:** This is an individual project to predict a wind turbine operating mode based on time series data from 2 sensors. Various models including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been used to identify the best performing model. The project has been guided by the [article on "CNN fault classification based on time series analysis for wind turbine machine" by Rahimilarki, Gao, Jin, and Zhang (2022).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148121017778) <br />
 **Technology:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Tensorflow.keras <br />
 **Results:** In addition to training different models including GRU, LTSM, 1D CNN and 2D CNN, the models convolutional layers, epochs, and learning rate have been optimised to obtain accuracies of above 80%. The best model identified was the 2D CNN with three convolutional layers due to its higher accuracy and lower training loss. The final model gave a test accuracy score of 0.91 and a loss of 0.23. <br />
 
### Project 4: Network analysis of directors and casts on Netflix 
**Repository:** [`Netflix Network Analysis`](https://github.com/ngyiling/netflix-network-analysis) <br />
**Description:** A group work to analyse the interpersonal relationships among directors and casts in movies produced in the UK between 2019 and 2021, whereby the relationship in the network is refered to the knowledge exchange in the form of collaboration among directors and casts.  <br />
**Technology:** Networkx, Matplotlib, Wordcloud, Pandas, NumPy <br />
