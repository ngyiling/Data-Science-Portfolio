# Hi there! I'm Yi Ling üëã
This repository consists of projects that I have done whilst pursuing my masters in Business Analytics at Bayes Business School. 

Through my projects, I developed proficiency in Python, R programming and SQL, and now I can carry out tasks, such as:
- carry out data cleaning and preprocessing 
- web scraping (using BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Twint API, Tweepy API, Reddit API)
- uncover patterns and insights
- communicate crtical findings with stakeholders

# Portfolio Projects
### Project 1: Effects of COVID-19 on UK businesses 
**Repository:**  [`Companies House Analysis`](https://github.com/ngyiling/companies-house-analysis) <br />
**Description:** This individual project aims to analyse Companies House data and produce data visualisations, to show the impact of the pandemic on UK business foundation patterns.  <br />
**Technology:** Pandas, Geopandas, Geopy, Plotly <br />

### Project 2: What makes TikTok' videos popular?
**Repository:** [`Popular TikTok Videos Visualisation`](https://github.com/ngyiling/popular-tiktok-videos-visualisation) <br />
**Description:** This group project aims to analyse 1000 trending TikTok videos and produce data visualisations that explain the underlying pattern of 'what makes TikTok videos popular!'. <br />
**Technology:** TextBlob, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Scipy <br />


 ### Project 3: Prediction of wind turbine operating mode
 **Repository:** [`Wind Turbine Operating Mode Predictions`](https://github.com/ngyiling/wind-turbine-operating-mode-prediction) <br />
 **Description:** This is an individual project to predict a wind turbine operating mode based on time series data from 2 sensors. Various models including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been used to identify the best performing model. <br />
 **Technology:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Tensorflow.keras <br />
 
### Project 4: Network analysis of directors and casts on Netflix 
**Repository:** [`Netflix Network Analysis`](https://github.com/ngyiling/netflix-network-analysis) <br />
**Description:** A group work to analyse the interpersonal relationships among directors and casts in movies produced in the UK between 2019 and 2021, whereby the relationship in the network is refered to the knowledge exchange in the form of collaboration among directors and casts.  <br />
**Technology:** Networkx, Matplotlib, Wordcloud, Pandas, NumPy <br />
 
 ### Project 5: Machine Learning Shiny App (R)
 **Repository:** [`Shiny App ML`](https://github.com/ngyiling/shiny-app-ML) <br />
 **Description:** A Shiny app showing the differences between the prediction outcome of two classifiers: Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF). The dataset consists of direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank, and the goal is to predict whether clients will subscribe ('yes') or not ('no') to a term deposit based on phone calls to them. <br />
 **Technology:** Shiny, Caret, Dplyr, Rattle <br />
<br />
 
 ### Project 6: Customer segmentation using Machine Learning (R) <br />
 **Repository:** [`Customer Segmentation using ML`](https://github.com/ngyiling/customer-segmentation-ML) <br />
 **Description:** The aim of this project is to utilise Machine Learning to analyse the [customer-personality.csv](https://github.com/ngyiling/customer-segmentation-ML/blob/main/customer-personality.csv) dataset to understand customer behaviours and purchasing patterns. 
<br />
 **Technology:** dplyr, Hmisc, ggplot2, ggfortify  <br />
<br />
 
 ### Project 7: Insurance Claims Fraud Detection
 **Repository:** [`Insurance Claims Fraud Detection`](https://github.com/ngyiling/Insurance-claims-fraud-detection) <br />
 **Description:** This project is a fraud classification of an ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù data set of car insurance claims. The [insurance-claims.csv](https://github.com/ngyiling/Insurance-claims-fraud-detection/blob/main/Insurance_claims.csv) dataset consists of more than 10,000 claims, with only 100 fraudulent claims among all the claims. Pre-processing of the dataset followed by 3 types of classifications: SMOTE, Autoencoder, SMOTE with Decision Tree was carried out to identify the best classification model. <br />
 **Technology:** sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, tensorflow, keras, SMOTE, imblearn <br />


### Project 8: Pricing Strategy of a UK Highway Toll (Dart Charge) (R)
**Repository:** [`Pricing Strategy of a UK Highway Toll`](https://github.com/ngyiling/pricing-strategy-of-UK-highway-toll) <br />
**Description:** This aim of this project is to carry out price optimisation and capacity allocation of Dartford Crossing, UK - one of the busiest highways M25 in England - in accordance to 3 potential objectives: maximise toll revenue, minimise emissions, or maximise throughput.  <br />
**Technology:** dplyr, stargazer, lattice, nloptr
